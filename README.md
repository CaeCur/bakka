# Bakka - TikTok Clone

## Introduction

This web app serves to teach myself more about:

- TypeScript
- React
- Next.js
- Sanity
- Google Auth via OAuth

The name Bakka arises from the word created by Frank Herbert in his Dune novels. Herbert created the word as a reference to the arabic word "bakkah" which means to crowd in a place such as a bazaar. Herbert's version of the word relates to someone tasked with mourning for mankind.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
